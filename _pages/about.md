Hello! My name is Yewon Lee, and I am originally from South Korea. I studied at Yonsei University, where I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in Library and Information Science. After a year-long internship at Columbia University, where I gained experience in library work, I decided to shift my focus towards IT technology. During my Master's in Library and Information Science, which I completed in 2023, I was primarily involved in numerous biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

I am currently a freshman at Drexel University, continuing my studies in the same field. I am eager to delve deeper and expand my knowledge into areas such as Artificial Intelligence, particularly focusing on its applications and capabilities within the healthcare environment.
